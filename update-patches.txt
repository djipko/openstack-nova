Here is how I updated the fedora-openstack/master branch to essex-3 + ...

0. Ensure up to date

git fetch --all

1. Rebase our patches onto essex-3

git checkout master-patches
    Switched to branch 'master-patches'
git log --oneline # to pick sha of commit _before_ first commit to consider rebasing
git rebase --onto essex-3 69fcb2df # use --interactive if want to edit/delete commits
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Applying: Ensure we don't access the net when building docs

2. Pick new patches after essex-3

git log remotes/openstack/master # to find sha of other commits
git cherry-pick ed6e3efc
    [master-patches 126e601] fix `nova-manage image convert` exception
# You can also cherry pick commits from gerrit by copy and pasting the cherry-pick commands from there

3. Update the patches on master

git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
./update-patches.sh
    rm '0001-Ensure-we-don-t-access-the-net-when-building-docs.patch'
    [master da3a165] Updated patches from master-patches
     1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 25 deletions(-)
     delete mode 100644 0001-Ensure-we-don-t-access-the-net-when-building-docs.patch
    Switched to branch 'master-patches'
    Your branch and 'fedora-openstack/master' have diverged,
    and have 1747 and 281 different commit(s) each, respectively.
    Switched to branch 'master'
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    [master 0c2be04] Updated patches from master-patches
     3 files changed, 30 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 0002-fix-nova-manage-image-convert-exception.patch

4. Update changelog and version in spec file as appropriate and push

git commit --amend -a
fedpkg prep # to be sure to be sure the patches apply
git push

5. Push updated master-patches back to github
(note the '+' below to allow non fast-forward updates)

git push fedora-openstack +master-patches:master

The same process applies for fedora-openstack/f16-patches.
Note el6 patches are not yet maintained in git, so
for now just merge from f16 (diablo).
Note f17 patches are not yet maintained in git, so
for now just merge from master (essex).
